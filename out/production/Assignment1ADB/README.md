### Using the added CLI for the Undo/Redo program (Assignment #4)

Once running, the program accepts the following commands:

| Command            | Description                                   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `add <text>`       | Adds a new state to the list                  |
| `undo`             | Goes back to the previous state               |
| `redo`             | Moves forward to the next state (if possible) |
| `current`          | Displays the current state                    |
| `history`          | Prints all states and shows the current one   |
| `quit`             | Exits the program                             |


- All functionality for Assignment #3 "Linked List Delete Method" is contained within *SingleLinkedListTest.java* within the "Assignment3" Folder.
- To test the functionality of the delete methods, run SingleLinkedListTest.java and observe the terminal results.

# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my coursework for the Data Structures and Algorithms class. Each assignment is organized in a dedicated folder with a corresponding number (e.g., Assignment1, Assignment2).

## Repository Structure
